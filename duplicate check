--With the data not having any null values, I did want to check it for any duplicates.
  --I loaded it into SQL and the crash_date looks like a unique identifier. 
  --Therefore, I ran a quick query to check for any duplicates

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT crash_date), crash_date FROM traffic_accidents
GROUP BY crash_date
ORDER BY crash_date DESC;

--This returned no COUNT value greater than 1, which (along with the python script to check for null values) points to this data being clean.
